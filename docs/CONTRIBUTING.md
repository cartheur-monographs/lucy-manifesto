## Principles

- Keep claims traceable to source material.
- Prefer precise engineering language over narrative language.
- Mark assumptions explicitly when source evidence is incomplete.

## Writing Rules

- One requirement per bullet or sentence when possible.
- Separate facts, assumptions, and proposals.
- Use consistent terminology: "Lucy prototype", "manifesto", "requirement", "constraint".

## Review Checklist

- Is each claim sourced or clearly marked as an assumption?
- Are units, tolerances, and manufacturing constraints explicit?
- Are contradictions between sections resolved?
- Are unresolved decisions tracked as open questions?

## Versioning

- Use incremental versions (`v0.1`, `v0.2`, `v1.0`).
- Record major edits with short rationale in commit messages.
