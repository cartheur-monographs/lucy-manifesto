# Project Brief (v0.1)

## Objective

Build a physically credible Lucy Mk-II prototype derived from the concept image, optimized for:

- rapid iteration
- mixed fabrication (printed polymer + outsourced metal)
- testable electromechanical performance

## Explicit Assumptions

- The image is a concept target, not a dimensioned drawing.
- Anthropomorphic upper body is the priority.
- First build is a non-walking torso platform with head + arms.
- Real-time behaviors are staged: calibration and controlled motions first, adaptive intelligence later.

## In Scope (Build v0.1)

- Head/neck assembly with 2-3 DoF
- Two arms with shoulder/elbow/wrist-lite (target 4-6 DoF per arm in staged rollout)
- Torso frame with service access and mounting rails
- Internal cable routing and modular electronics bay
- Power distribution, motor control, and sensor feedback
- Basic shell panels for visual fidelity to concept

## Out of Scope (Build v0.1)

- Full biped locomotion
- Dexterous five-finger manipulation
- Production finish quality
- Environmental hardening

## Success Criteria

- Mechanical: stable structure, acceptable backlash, no structural cracking after baseline motion tests
- Electrical: stable power under peak load, no brownout in normal operation
- Control: repeatable homing/calibration and deterministic command execution
- Integration: serviceable wiring, component replacement without full teardown

## Constraints

- Plastic parts must be printable on available in-house 3D printer
- Metal parts must be suitable for common fabrication services (laser/waterjet/CNC, off-the-shelf stock)
- Budget sensitivity: prioritize reusable modules and standard parts
