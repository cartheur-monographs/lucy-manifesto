# Lucy Mk-II Build Project

This folder is a standalone project to turn the Lucy Mk-II concept figure into a buildable prototype using:

- FDM 3D printing for plastic parts
- External fabrication service for metal parts

## Document Map

- `mk-2/01-project-brief.md`: scope, assumptions, and success criteria
- `mk-2/02-system-architecture.md`: subsystem decomposition and interfaces
- `mk-2/03-mechanical-design.md`: structure, joints, materials, and CAD strategy
- `mk-2/04-electronics-control.md`: power, compute, motor control, sensing, and wiring
- `mk-2/05-manufacturing-plan.md`: print rules, outsourced metal process, tolerances, and DFM
- `mk-2/06-assembly-integration.md`: assembly sequence, fixtures, calibration, and integration workflow
- `mk-2/07-test-validation.md`: verification matrix and acceptance tests
- `mk-2/08-risk-register.md`: technical risks with mitigations
- `mk-2/bom-v0.1.csv`: preliminary bill of materials
- `mk-2/work-breakdown.md`: phased execution plan

## Current Status

This is `v0.1` planning and architecture. No CAD or fabrication files are generated yet.
