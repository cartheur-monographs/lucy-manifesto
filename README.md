# The Lucy Manifesto

The design and manufacturing criteria for the Lucy prototype.

## Purpose

This repository is the working home for an evolving manifesto built from `source.pdf`.
The goal is to progressively extract, structure, and refine the source material into a clear engineering proposal.

## Project Status

This is the initial project setup (`v0` scaffold).

## Repository Layout

- `README.md`: project overview and workflow
- `source.pdf`: canonical source material
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`: phased implementation plan
- `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`: writing and review standards
- `docs/PROJECT_OUTLINE.md`: GA144-based Lucy revitalization outline

## Workflow

1. Extract source text from `source.pdf` into working notes.
2. Organize notes into themed sections (requirements, constraints, manufacturing).
3. Draft manifesto chapters.
4. Review for technical consistency and decision traceability.
5. Publish versioned revisions.

## First Milestones

- Define chapter structure for the manifesto.
- Produce first extracted notes set from `source.pdf`.
- Deliver a draft `v0.1` manifesto document.
